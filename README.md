## Overview

This project aims to explore how evolutionary pressure from a human controlled predator effects the swarming behaviour and field of view of a computer simulated prey. To do this, you will play a basic game. Please install the required packages from the 'requirements.txt' folder and fill out the player form before starting. To run the game, simply run the 'main.py' file from either your terminal or a source code editor. This will explain the game and describe how your data will be collected and used. Thanks, Freddie.

## Instructions

This research is for a MEng Technical Project. Entry in this study is optional and participants can opt out at any time during the game (but not after, as I will not be able to tell the data is from you).

In this game, you will control a predator marked by a red arrow which will move towards your mouse. Your aim is to catch as many of the prey as you can in the time limit. Each round will last around 25 seconds and you will complete 40 rounds to fully evolve the prey. You will do this twice, once where all predator attacks are successful, and another where the predator will be less successful against prey in groups than individuals. The order of the two modes will be randomised. The total duration will be roughly 30 minutes.  

This study will collect your age, gender and the positional data of your predator and mouse in the game. No further data will be recorded and I will delete your email if you send data via email as soon as I have downloaded the attached data. Because all data is anonymous, I cannot delete your data once you have taken part. In case you have questions of concerns about this study, please contact myself (hb20788@bristol.ac.uk), my project supervisor (nikolai.bode@bristol.ac.uk), or research governance (research-governance@bristol.ac.uk).

You will direct the predator with your mouse and you must aim to catch as many of the prey as you can in each round. The predator will be stationary for the start of each round to allow the prey to form groups. The predator will also be stationary when for a short period of time after attempting an attack. Finally, the boundaries for the prey can be passed through resulting in them appearing on the other side of the screen. They are solid for the predator. Consider how the different game modes could affect your hunting strategies. Press the spacebar at any time to pause the game or exit.




## Setup
### Prerequisites
- [Python 3.6 or higher](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
### Installation
Clone the repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone <repository url>
```
Change to the project directory:
```bash
cd <project directory>
```
Install the dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## Usage

Run the program in your terminal
```bash
python main.py
```
Or run using a source code editor like Visual Studio Code

## Submit your data
Running the code will produce an output folder containing all the simulation data. You can find this in the same folder as main.py.
Please email the whole output folder called 'OUTPUT' to Freddie Marsh at hb20788@bristol.ac.uk. You may find it easier to compress the folder first.
