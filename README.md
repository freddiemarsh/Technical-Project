## Setup
### Prerequisites
- [Python 3.6 or higher](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
### Installation
Clone the repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone <repository url>
```
Change to the project directory:
```bash
cd <project directory>
```
Install the dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## Usage

Run the program in your terminal
```bash
python main.py
```
Or run using a source code editor like Visual Studio Code

## Submit your data
Running the code will produce an output folder containing all the simulation data. You can find this in the same folder as main.py.
Please email the whole output folder called 'OUTPUT' to Freddie Marsh at hb20788@bristol.ac.uk. You may find it easier to compress the folder first.
