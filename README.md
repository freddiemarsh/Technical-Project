## Overview

This project aims to explore how evolutionary pressure from a human controlled predator effects the swarming behaviour and field of view of a computer simulated prey. To do this, you will play a basic game. Please install the required packages from the 'requirements.txt' folder and fill out the player form before starting. To run the game, simply run the 'main.py' file from either your terminal or a source code editor. This will explain the game and describe how your data will be collected and used. Thanks, Freddie.

## Setup
### Prerequisites
- [Python 3.6 or higher](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
### Installation
Clone the repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone <repository url>
```
Change to the project directory:
```bash
cd <project directory>
```
Install the dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## Usage

Run the program in your terminal
```bash
python main.py
```
Or run using a source code editor like Visual Studio Code

## Submit your data
Running the code will produce an output folder containing all the simulation data. You can find this in the same folder as main.py.
Please email the whole output folder called 'OUTPUT' to Freddie Marsh at hb20788@bristol.ac.uk. You may find it easier to compress the folder first.
